- 💬 Ask me about: “Design is thinking made visual.” —Saul Bass

This quote by Academy Award Winner Film Maker and graphic designer Saul Bass made me ponder and truly it made a perfect sense to me. What spirals in mind, transforms to ideas of creativity and then putting them on a drawing board through sketches and work on the systems to define them became a way of life for me! I was awe inspired by this new found enthusiasm to create visual treats while playing high resolution games. There were many elements that drew my attention and began critically thinking and looking at various improvements that could be made to the visual effects in the production of movies, video games, computer games and designing. This gave me the necessary impetus to the trajectory of programming, gaming and the visual effects thereby use my instincts, enterprising mind set through a Bachelor’s Degree in Engineering in Computer Engineering.

After completing my Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Engineering from India, I moved to the United States to further work on my skill set. I am a student at University of Texas at Arlington currently pursuing Masters in Computer Science. Here, I have been learning and gaining knowledge on Web Development, Game Designing, Databases, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Neural Networks, with the same passion that has driven me from day one. Currently working on improving my skill sets in the domain of Web Development and Game Programming to achieve what the ten year old me always wanted. An individual who could bring his creations to life.

When I’m not working, I love playing Soccer, sketching and also occasionally picking up and jamming a few songs with my guitar.

I am currently looking for summer and fall internship opportunities, preferably for the same.
